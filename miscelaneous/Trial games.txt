Game 1

Computer as X plays first on centre square.
Human as O plays a corner
Computer plays opposite corner
Human plays 7
Comp plays 4 ******
Hum plays 3


Game 2

Human as O plays center
Computer as X plays an empty corner say 3
Human plays 7
Comp plays 1 since the choice is of a side or corner
Human blocks at 2
Comp plays 8 *
Human plays 6

At this final position in game 2 it is clear there is still a bug in the code but it would seem that a number of strategic rules probably need to be added to any game code including filling the center on the first/second move if available.  Taking the oposite corner if an opponent fills a corner on the second move.  Choosing a corner rather that a side in the first place where there are choices.
